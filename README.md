These are just some tests made to understand the board LILYGO-SIM7000G-V1_1.
The tests use the example sketches supplied by the repository:

https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGO-T-SIM7000G

Created a folder 'examples' with the following examples:

1- 'US100_ultrasonic_sensor'  contains the files for the ultrasonic sensor tests including the pins connection.

2- 'Send_SMS_test' sends SMS message to a cell phone number.

3- 'Arduino_LoraShield/LoRaReceiver' receive messages from LoRa Radio.

4- 'Arduino_LoraShield/LoRaSender' Send messages to LoRa Radio.

*All these examples were tested and are running.
